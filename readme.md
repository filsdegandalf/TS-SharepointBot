# Sharepoint Bot Typescript Version

This work is based on the Sharepoint Bot from Franck Cornu :  <https://github.com/FranckyC/SharePointBot>

This is a Starter kit that use Bot Framework with 1 QnA Service & a Sharepoint Search Interface.

Every response in the QnA surrounded with curly bracket ({}) will be interpreted as search query buy the bot and the corresponding search results will be returned as thumbnail card.

It's a basic bot, if you want to add some 'human being' interface, you should think about add a Luis service.
